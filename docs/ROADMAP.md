# Portfolio Architect roadmap

This roadmap records intended sequencing rather than a compatibility promise. Each
milestone remains subject to design, security review, tests, and live acceptance.

## v1.22.0 — publication and privacy hardening

Completed: source/history/artifact privacy gates and immutable secret scanning are
release invariants.

## v1.23.0 — provider-aware Gateway foundation

Completed: the hardened Gateway server consumes a provider-neutral runtime contract
and health schema 6 carries bounded provider identity. The existing Comdirect App
retained its historical slug/private state.

## v1.24.0 / v1.24.1 — distinct provider Gateway Apps

Completed: three separately installable provider App identities with isolated
private storage: **Portfolio Architect Gateway — Comdirect**, **Portfolio Architect
Gateway — DKB**, and **Portfolio Architect Gateway — Trade Republic**. Version
v1.24.1 corrected reduced-shell startup and added protected running-container smoke
tests.

Comdirect remains the stable live provider. DKB remains an experimental fail-closed
shell until a separate supported acquisition design is implemented.

## v1.25.0 — Trade Republic statement import

Completed and live-accepted: the separate Trade Republic App accepts the supported
German text-PDF `DEPOTAUSZUG` holdings-statement family through its admin-only
Ingress page, parses the document locally in memory, and publishes only a validated
provider-neutral holdings snapshot through REST schema 1.

real Trade Republic statements remain private input; public tests use wholly synthetic documents/fixtures only, generated as runtime PDF data; unsupported/ambiguous documents fail closed.

## v1.26.0 — multiple Gateway REST aggregation

Published, but not accepted as the known-good multi-provider baseline: the release
successfully added/validated the Trade Republic Gateway and exposed three portfolio
sources in live operation, while live acceptance revealed that the calculation path
still assumed target holdings were keyed by WKN. An ISIN-only Trade Republic
Robotics holding therefore remained outside the configured target architecture.

The milestone requires:

- preserving the existing primary REST configuration and adding/removing additional
  local Gateways through config-entry options;
- health-schema-6 provider identity and live snapshot validation before an
  additional Gateway is accepted;
- atomic aggregation with no silent provider dropout;
- source-set-aware Home Assistant LKG retention during an additional-Gateway outage;
- distinct `provider_count` / `provider_ids` metadata alongside source-instance
  count and existing per-position provenance;
- the reference dashboard showing a distinct-provider summary; and
- Trade Republic auto-start once it can be a persistent REST contributor.

Payload schema 8, REST schema 1, Gateway health schema 6, entity IDs, authorized-cash
semantics and the read-only/no-trading boundary remain unchanged.

## v1.26.1 — ISIN-first identity hotfix

Current milestone: complete v1.26 live acceptance by making ISIN the canonical
instrument identity throughout target matching and cross-source aggregation.

- ISIN is primary whenever available.
- WKN is fallback identity only when ISIN is unavailable.
- When both are present, WKN is consistency evidence and cannot override an ISIN.
- Ambiguous or contradictory ISIN/WKN mappings fail closed.
- The regression suite uses the real Trade Republic REST identity shape: ISIN-only
  provider position, no synthetic WKN injection.
- Successful live acceptance must establish 3 sources / 3 providers / 7 of 7,
  followed by the planned Trade Republic outage/LKG/recovery proof.

The next security-hardening milestone is HTTPS for Gateway-to-Portfolio-Architect
transport on the private Home Assistant App network. Certificate provisioning,
verification and upgrade-safe trust must be designed without disabling TLS
verification or replacing the existing dedicated bearer authentication.

## Later provider acquisition work

The DKB App still requires its own supported acquisition/import design before it can
replace or complement the existing DKB CSV source. Provider-specific acquisition
must remain inside the corresponding Gateway App; Portfolio Architect should
continue to consume only canonical provider-neutral snapshots.
