# Changelog

## 1.18.0

- Adds a private two-evaluation Plan Delta & Decision Trace.
- Adds `sensor.portfolio_architect_plan_change` with bounded translated states and stable per-position reason codes.
- Suppresses drift-only changes below 0.10 pp and non-zero purchase changes below EUR 1.00 while always reporting status transitions and additions/removals.
- Prevents REST last-known-good replay from advancing the decision trace.
- Adds a native bilingual conditional dashboard tile and privacy-conscious diagnostics.
- Protects the private history with canonical SHA-256 validation and excludes detailed trace attributes from recorder history.
- Preserves payload schema 8, REST schema 1, Gateway health schema 5, allocation, policy, execution, and existing entity contracts.

## 1.17.2

- Fixes the HACS release asset so integration files are stored directly at the ZIP root.
- Retains the wrapped `custom_components/portfolio_architect/` layout for the manual Home Assistant drop-in.
- Adds release verification for channel-specific archive roots and complete payload equivalence after prefix normalization.
- Adds a regression test that rejects the v1.17.1 nested-HACS packaging failure.
- Preserves the v1.17.1 runtime, security hardening, portfolio behavior, entities, dashboards, and Gateway protocols.

## 1.17.1

- Supersedes the unpublished v1.17.0 publication candidate.
- Pins every reusable GitHub Action to a full 40-character commit SHA.
- Runs the HACS and hassfest validators from immutable GHCR image digests because
  their upstream wrapper actions currently delegate to mutable container tags.
- Adds fail-closed workflow checks that reject mutable action refs and container
  image tags.
- Pins validation and release jobs to Ubuntu 24.04 and Python 3.14.6, and installs
  every direct and transitive Python validation dependency from a version- and
  SHA-256-locked wheel list with hash enforcement and no dependency resolution;
  the set uses Pygments 2.20.0 rather than the vulnerable 2.19.2 release.
- Removes the local REST DNS validation/connection race by resolving once,
  validating every returned address, and binding the request to that exact
  address set while preserving the original Host header, TLS SNI, and certificate
  name validation.
- Disables redirects, environment proxies, and cookie persistence for authenticated
  local REST requests.
- Strengthens generated CODEOWNERS coverage for workflows, dependency automation,
  publication tooling, the integration, and both Gateway distributions; the
  inactive example file is removed after repository configuration.
- Adds executable regression tests for pinned DNS transport and immutable
  publication dependencies.
- Preserves the v1.16.3 portfolio calculation, entity, dashboard, fee, and Gateway
  protocol contracts.

Historical release details are retained in `docs/UPGRADE-*.md` and the source
history.
